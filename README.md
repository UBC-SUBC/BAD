# BAD Code + Tests


Assigns an encoding for each combination of θ, θ', and θ''. This encoding will help determine in which direction we need to shift the centre of buoyancy and what magnitude. There are two stages of encoding, the first one is three digits and represents the polarities of θ, θ', and θ''. The second uses this first encoding to assign instructions for the shift in the centre of buoyancy. More details are commented in the code itself.
